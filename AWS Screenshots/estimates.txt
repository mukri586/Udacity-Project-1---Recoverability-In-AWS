RTO
#####################################

It's a multi-region and multi-AZ RDS Database with a read replica configured in standby region. If for some reason let's say Primary DB goes down in a region or AZ at 00:00 hours:

00:00 - Problem occurs
00:05 - An alert is triggered in 5 minutes
00:15 - 10 minutes for on-call support personnel to get ready and login
00:25 - 10 minutes for diagnosis of the issue
00:40 - 15 minutes for the identification of the root cause
00:50 - 10 minutes to promote read replica as Primary and redirect traffic

Based on the above steps, estimated recovery time or RTO is 50 minutes approximately.

RPO
#####################################

RPO relies on transaction log backups which happens every 5 minutes within AWS RDS. This is in addition to the daily snapshots. So RPO in this case is 5 minutes, if for some reason the data gets corrupted in the Primary DB, it will corrupt the data in Read replica as well. RDS will have to be restored from the last correct transaction log back which was taken 5 minutes ago.

Based on the above explaination RPO is 5 minutes
